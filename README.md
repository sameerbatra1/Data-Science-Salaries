# 📊 Predicting Data Science Salaries in 2025  
**TEAM 3 – DATS 6101 Final Project**  
_Last updated: April 8, 2025_

---

## Project Overview  
This final project builds on our midterm exploration of data science salary trends. We now extend the analysis by applying regression and machine learning models to **predict the average salary of Data Scientists in 2025** based on data from 2020 to 2024.  

Using a dataset of 6,599 observations from Kaggle, we explore relationships between job roles, experience levels, remote work arrangements, and compensation, and compare different modeling techniques to determine the most accurate predictor.
