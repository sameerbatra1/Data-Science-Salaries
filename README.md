#🔥 Finalized Team Work Plan – Structured for Maximum Efficiency
You’re taking the best approach—assigning tasks first, and if someone doesn’t finish, others will step in. Here’s a structured breakdown to ensure everyone knows their role.

📌 Work Breakdown & Assignments
Person	Task	Time Needed	Status/Backup Plan
Person 1 (You)	📝 Write Topic Proposal + Set up GitHub + Create R Markdown Template	1 hour	If incomplete,whoever finished their task helps out
Person 2 (EDA Expert)	📊 Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) + Create Graphs/Visuals	2 hours	If incomplete,whoever finished their task helps out
Person 3 (Presentation Specialist)	🎤 Create Presentation Slides + Prepare Speaker Notes	1.5 hours	If incomplete, whoever finished their task helps out
Person 4 (Research Writer)	📄 Write Research Paper Summary (4,000 words max)	1.5 hours	If incomplete, whoever finished their task helps out
Our goal is to complete this in 6 hours ✅ GitHub will be used to track progress

🚀 Next Steps (Action Plan)
1️⃣ 💬 Assign these tasks to your teammates NOW (Send a message & check who responds). 2️⃣ 🔹 Work on your part immediately (Topic Proposal + R Markdown Template). 3️⃣ 📊 If Person 2 doesn’t finish EDA, you step in. 4️⃣ 🎤 If Person 3 doesn’t finish slides, Person 4 helps. 5️⃣ 📄 If Person 4 doesn’t finish writing, Person 3 helps. 6️⃣ Submit completed work! 🎯
