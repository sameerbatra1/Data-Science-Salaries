This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.  

```{r include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, results='markup'}
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Load dataset
salaries <- read.csv('data_science_salaries.csv')

# Display first few rows
head(salaries)

# Check column names to ensure correctness
colnames(salaries)
```

###How do salaries vary across different experience levels in data science?
```{r include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, results='markup'}
# Compute average salary and salary in USD by experience level
experience_salary <- salaries %>%
  group_by(experience_level) %>%
  summarise(
    Avg_Salary = mean(salary, na.rm = TRUE),
    Avg_Salary_USD = mean(salary_in_usd, na.rm = TRUE),
    Count = n()
  )

# Display summary table
print(experience_salary)

# Visualize with Boxplot
ggplot(salaries, aes(x = experience_level, y = salary_in_usd, fill = experience_level)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Salary Distribution by Experience Level", x = "Experience Level", y = "Salary in USD")

```
###What is the average salary difference between remote and in-person data science jobs?
```{r include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, results='markup'}
# Ensure necessary libraries are loaded
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Check column names to verify correct variable name
colnames(salaries)

# Convert work_models to a factor (important for t-test)
salaries$work_models <- as.factor(salaries$work_models)

# Compute average salary by work model
work_model_salary <- salaries %>%
  group_by(work_models) %>%
  summarise(
    Avg_Salary = mean(salary, na.rm = TRUE),
    Avg_Salary_USD = mean(salary_in_usd, na.rm = TRUE),
    Count = n()
  )

# Display results
print(work_model_salary)

# Perform t-test to check if salary difference is significant
if (length(unique(salaries$work_models)) == 2) {  # Ensure exactly two categories exist
  t_test_result <- t.test(salary_in_usd ~ work_models, data = salaries, na.action = na.omit)
  print(t_test_result)
} else {
  print("T-test cannot be performed: work_models column does not have exactly two groups.")
}

# Boxplot of Salary by Work Model
ggplot(salaries, aes(x = work_models, y = salary_in_usd, fill = work_models)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Salary Comparison: Remote vs. In-Person", x = "Work Model", y = "Salary in USD")


```


###Does the salary gap between experience levels remain consistent across industries?
```{r include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, results='markup'}
# Compute salary statistics by experience level and industry
industry_experience_salary <- salaries %>%
  group_by(company_location, experience_level) %>%
  summarise(
    Avg_Salary = mean(salary, na.rm = TRUE),
    Avg_Salary_USD = mean(salary_in_usd, na.rm = TRUE),
    Count = n()
  )

# Display table
print(industry_experience_salary)

# Visualize using Faceted Boxplot
ggplot(salaries, aes(x = experience_level, y = salary_in_usd, fill = experience_level)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~ company_location) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Salary Gap Across Experience Levels by Industry", x = "Experience Level", y = "Salary in USD")

```
###Does the salary gap between experience levels remain consistent across industries?
```{r include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, results='markup'}
# Compute salary statistics by experience level and industry
industry_experience_salary <- salaries %>%
  group_by(company_location, experience_level) %>%
  summarise(
    Avg_Salary = mean(salary, na.rm = TRUE),
    Avg_Salary_USD = mean(salary_in_usd, na.rm = TRUE),
    Count = n()
  )

  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~ company_location) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Salary Gap Across Experience Levels by Industry", x = "Experience Level", y = "Salary in USD")

```

###How have salary trends in data science evolved from 2020 to 2024?

```{r include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, results='markup'}
# Compute average salary by year
salary_trends <- salaries %>%
  group_by(work_year) %>%
  summarise(
    Avg_Salary = mean(salary, na.rm = TRUE),
    Avg_Salary_USD = mean(salary_in_usd, na.rm = TRUE),
    Count = n()
  )

# Display results
print(salary_trends)

# Line plot for Salary Trends
ggplot(salary_trends, aes(x = work_year, y = Avg_Salary_USD)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue", size = 1) +
  geom_point(color = "red", size = 2) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Salary Trends in Data Science (2020-2024)", x = "Year", y = "Average Salary in USD")
```
